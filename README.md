# Generative-AI
In recent times supervised learning with convolutional networks (CNNs) has explored more than unsupervised learning. In this work we tried to work on deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs)which is a class of CNN.Image Generation is a task of generating new images using existing or similar images. GANâ€™ s (Generative Adversarial Network) are type of machine learning model that is well suited for image generation. DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks) uses the image generated by GAN and gives feedback regarding the quality of fake images to GAN. DCGAN mainly consists of two networks namely Generator and Discriminator.These two networks are trained together in adversarial manner such that the generator becomes better creating more realistic fake images that fool the discriminator. In this paper we generated fake images using DCGAN by giving an input dataset.
